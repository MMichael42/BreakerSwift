# BreakerSwift
Swift port of the brick breaker game I made with Unity

A simple inifite breakout style game written in swift, using the SpriteKit framework. This is 1.0 complete, meaning the game is playable,
but there is room for a lot of growth (highscores online, multiball modes, hard difficulties, etc).
